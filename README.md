# Pig Value Iteration Replication Study

This repository attempts to replicate the results of the paper:

> Neller, T. W., & Presser, C. G. (2004). Optimal play of the dice game pig. *The UMAP Journal*, 25(1).

This paper uses value iteration to find the optimal policy for the games Piglet and Pig. 

A report can be found in `report.ipynb` which details the replication study and presents our results.

## Installation

This repository can be installed using `git clone`.
To clone the repository and install it locally, run the following commands in terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/fwilson99/609_advanced_git.git
cd 609_advanced_git
pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

The core installation includes all necessary dependencies for running the package. 

## Files

The files included in this repository have various functions:
- The core replication of the Piglet results is in `piglet_manual.py`, and similarly the core replication of the Pig results are found in `pig_manual.py`.
- The `pig_game.py` code provides classes for creating a Pig player and running a Pig game. These classes are used in the competition code described in the prior point.
- The `optimal_policy.py` code is a module for extracting the optimal Pig policy from a value function.
- A utilities file, `utilities.py` provides helper functions for storing and loading data generated by the Pig and Piglet games to prevent rerunning code numerous times. Additionally, helper functions for the competition code are stored in this file.
- The file `Graphing_code_pig.py` computes the 3D plots corresponding to the roll/ hold decision boundary of the optimal Pig player which are present in the original publication.
- Lastly, the `report.ipynb` is a notebook presenting the results of the replication study.
